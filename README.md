# SpotiGuessr
A spin on the hit internet game GeoGuessr, created using React and Spotify's Web API.

How to play:
1. Enter a playlist link that is publicly accessible
2. Click the "Start Game" button
3. A song will start playing, guess it's name (not case sensitive, but otherwise must match song name exactly)
4. If you guess correctly, a different song from the playlist will start playing.
5. You win once you guess all the songs!

NOTE: Sometimes the song has no preview URL, and thus will not play. In these cases, click the "i don't hear audio" button

Have fun!!! This is a very early version of the game so there will be bugs. UI in progress.
